Beergle

The Search Engine for Beer

Project Overview

Project Name

Beergle

Project Description

My app is the internets newest Search Engine for finding you the right beer! Many people enjoy beer, but don't know enough to branch out into the vast world of Beer. They stick to what they know. With Beergle, you can expand your horizons to tastes you've never experienced. Just enter in your search paramters and we'll do the rest. If you like Ipas, we can find some for you. If you like lagers, we can find that too. If you have a new brewery in mind and want to learn more, just pop it into the search bar and you'll have it in no time!
