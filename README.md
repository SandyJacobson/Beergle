Beergle

Project Description

My app is the internets newest Search Engine for finding you the right beer! Many people enjoy beer, but don't know enough to branch out into the vast world of Beer. They stick to what they know. With Beergle, you can expand your horizons to tastes you've never experienced. Just enter in your search paramters and we'll do the rest. If you like Ipas, we can find some for you. If you like lagers, we can find that too. If you have a new brewery in mind and want to learn more, just pop it into the search bar and you'll have it in no time!

MVP


- My main MVP is to have a functioning website. 


- Aside from the flexbox/mediaquery requirements. I want to incorporate a CSS structure that is simple and pretty.


- I want people to be able to search for their favorite beverages and have easy and digestible data populate for them.


PostMVP


- Add a compare feature


- Incorporate a second API to make the website search library include cocktails and spirits, as well as beer.
